How to backup your openHABian server using Amanda
=================================================

# Intro
## The need for recovery
First, make yourself aware how important a comprehensive backup and recovery concept is.
Yes, this text is the README on the backup software part for openHABian that you're reading, but take a couple of minutes to
read and think about recovery in a generic sense first. This might avoid a LOT of frustration.

So you have your smart home working thanks to openHAB(ian).... but what if a component of your system fails ?
First thing is: you need spare hardware of EVERY component that needs to work for your smart home to work.
Think of EVERY relevant component and not just the obvious ones. Think of your Internet router, switch, server, NAS and required
addons such as a ZWave or 433MHz radio or WiFi USB stick, proper power supplies and the SD card writer.
Now think of a recovery concept for each of these components: what do you have to do if it fails ?

If the SD card in your Pi fails because of SD corruption (a very common problem), you need to have a PREinstalled, at least
somewhat current clone SD card to contain all your current OS packages, including all helper programs you might be using (such
as say mosquitto or any scripts you might have installed yourself), and your matching CURRENT openHAB config, and more.
If you believe "in case of SD card crash, I'll simply reinstall my server from scratch", then think first!
How long will that take you? Are you even capable of doing that ? Will the latest version of openHABian/Linux packages be 
guaranteed to work with each other and with your hardware ?
Do you REALLY remember all the parts and places of your system where you configured something related to your server/home
network and smart home ? If you're honest to yourself, the answer will often be "NO".
Yes, you can get your smart home back up working somehow, but it will take several hours, and it will not be a complete
restoration of all features and setups you used to have in operation before the crash.

**One specific word of WARNING:**
If you run a ZWave network like many openHAB users do, think what you need to do if the controller breaks and you need to
replace it. A new controller has a different Home ID, so all of your devices will not talk to it unless you re-include all of them (and
to physically access devices in quite a number of cases means you need to open your walls !!) And even if you have easy access,
it can take many hours, even more so if it's dark and your ... no I'm NOT joking, and I'm not overdoing things.
This is what happened to several people, and it can happen to you, too. We have seen people be so frustrated that they gave up
on openHAB or smart home altogether because of this.
For RaZberry/zwave.me USB stick, you can run the Z-Way software to backup and restore the ZWave network data including the
controller. For the Aeon Gen5 stick, there's a Windows tool available for download.
NOTE: you will face the same type of problem if you run a gateway unit to control commercial systems such as a HomeMatic CCU or Insteon
controller.
Remember Murphy's law: When your system fails and you need to restore your system for the first time, you'll notice your backup
is broken. So dive into and ensure you have a working restore procedure and don't just believe it'll work BUT TEST IT, and
repeat every now and then.

### SD card issues
As there's many many ways of operating a server, we can obviously only support a specific subset of all possible modes.
The most common setup for a openHAB smart home server is to run a Raspberry Pi off its internal SD card, so we provide a backup
concept for that one. But it will also work on most other SBCs (single board computers) and modified configurations (such as if
you moved your OS or parts thereof).

**Another word of WARNING:**
To move your system off the internal SD card does NOT solve SD corruption problems or increase reliability in any other way.
SD cards and USB sticks use the same technology. And SSDs and HDDs still can get corrupted as well, and they can crash, too.
You may or may not have or want to use Internet / cloud services for various reasons (privacy, bandwidth, cost), so we provide
you with one solution that is designed to run on local hardware only. We provide a config to use a directory as the backup
destination. This can be a directory mounted from your NAS (if you have one), a USB-attached storage stick, hard drive, or other
device. We also provide a config to store your most important data on Amazon Web Services if you are not afraid of that.
We believe this will cover most openHAB backup use cases.
NOTE: don't use CIFS (Windows sharing). If you have a NAS, use NFS instead. It does not work with CIFS because of issues with symlinks,
and it doesn't make sense to use a Windows protocol to share a disk from a UNIX server (all NAS) to a UNIX client (openHABian) at all.
If you don't have a NAS, DON'T use your Windows box as the storage server. Attach a USB stick to your Pi instead for storage.
There's many more possible configurations, the software is very flexible and you can tailor it to your own needs if those offers
do not match your needs. You could even use it to backup all of your servers (if any) and desktop PCs, including Windows
machines. Either way, it's not one-or-the-other, you can run multiple configs in parallel. But in any case, you will need to
have a clone SD card with your CURRENT config.

Now all that being said, let's turn to what what you're here for: how to accomplish the software side of backup and restoration.

## Some Amanda background
Best is to read up on and understand some of the basic Amanda concepts over at http://www.amanda.org.
That's not a mandatory step but it will probably help you understand a couple of things better.
The world of UNIX and backup IS complex and in the end, there's no way to fully hide that from a user.
Here's a couple of those concepts, but this is not a comprehensive list. I cannot understand the system for you,
that's something you have to accomplish on your own. Read and understand the Amanda docs.

* It's helpful to know that Amanda was originally built to use magnetic tape changer libraries as backup storage in professional
data center installations. It can operate multiple tape drives in parallel, and the tapes used to be commonly stored in what's
called a 'slot' inside the tape library cabinet.
* The default dumpcycle for a openHABian install is 2 weeks. Amanda will run a 'level 0' dump (that means to backup EVERYTHING)
once in a dumpcycle and will run 'level 1' dumps for the rest of the time (that means to only backup files that have CHANGED
since the last level 0 dump was done, also called an 'incremental' backup).
* Typically, for a backup system to use this methodology, you need the amount of storage to be 2-3 times as large as the amount
of data to be backed up. The number of tapes and their capacity (both of which are sort of artificially set when you store to a
filesystem) determines how long your storage capacity will last until Amanda starts to overwrite old backups. 
By asking you to enter the total size of the storage area, the Amanda installation routine will compute the maximum amount of 
data that Amanda will store into each tape subdirectory as (storage size) divided by (number of tapes, 15 by default).
The ability to backup to a directory was added later, but the 'slot', 'drive' and 'tape' concepts were kept. That's why here,
as a deployment inside openHABian, we will have 'virtual' tapes and slots which are implemented as subdirectories (one for each
'tape') and filesystem links (two by default config, drive0 and drive1) to point to a virtual tape.
If you have the drive1 link point to the slot3 directory, it effectively means that tape 3 is currently inserted in drive 1).
* Amanda was built on top of UNIX and makes use of its user and rights system, so it is very useful and you are requested to
familiarize yourself with that. As a general good UNIX practice, you shouldn’t use functional users such as “backup” (the OS
uses functional users to execute tasks with specific access rights) for administration tasks. Use your personal user instead
(that you have created that at the beginning of your openHABian installation or "openhabian" by default).
Installation tasks including post-package-installation changes (edits) of the Amanda config files, require to use the `root`
user. Any ordinary user (such as your personal one) can execute commands on behalf of root (and with root permission) by
prepending "sudo " to the command.

# Installation
## Storage preparation
Now once you read up on all of this and feel you have understood this stuff, the next step will NOT be hit that 'Amanda install' 
menu option in openHABian (no, we're not there yet) but to prepare your storage.
HEADS UP: You need to "create" (or "provide", actually) your storage BEFORE you install Amanda.
That is, you have to mount the USB stick or disk from your NAS to a directory that is LOCAL to your openHABian box.
Specifically for Windows users: if you are not familiar with the UNIX filesystem concept and what it means 'to mount' storage,
read up on it NOW. A generic (German language) intro can be found at http://www.pc-erfahrung.de/linux/linux-mounten.html.)
Google is your friend, but it'll give a lot of answers, each to vary slightly depending on the Linux variant or use case.
Make sure you ask specific questions such as “how to mount a NAS disk on a raspbian raspberry pi”.
So NOW, prepare your storage by creating a directory somewhere and by then mounting the USB device or disk you've previously
exported (= shared, i.e. made available for mounting) on that directory. This is your mountpoint.

Here's examples how to mount a NAS (to have the DNS name "nas" and IP address 192.168.1.100) and two partitions from an attached
USB stick identified as /dev/sda (Linux ext4 and Windows VFAT filesystems).

HEADS UP: These are just EXAMPLES. Device and directory names will be different on your system.
Do not deploy these commands unless you are fully aware what they will do to your system, using a command with a wrong device 
name can destroy your system.


### NAS mount example

### USB storage mount example

Note that this is showing two alternative versions, for FAT16/FAT32 filesystems (i.e. the original MS-DOS and the improved
Windows filesystems that you usually use for USB sticks) and another version to use the ext4 native Linux filesystem. You can 
use ext4 on a stick or USB-attached hard drive.
Either way, you just need one or the other.

## Software installation

Next (but only AFTER you successfully mounted/prepared your storage !), install Amanda using the openHABian menu.
When you start the Amanda installation from the openHABian menu, the install routine will create a directory/link structure in
the directory you tell it. Your local user named "backup" will need to have write access there. Amanda install routine should do
that for you, but it only CAN do it for you if you created/mounted it before you ran the installation.

Installation will ask you a couple of questions.
* "What's the directory to store backups into?"
Here you need to enter the _local_ directory of your openHABian box, also known as _the mount point_. This is where you have
mounted your USB storage or NAS disk share (which in above example for the NAS is `/storage/server` and for the usb stick is
either `/storage/usbstick-linux` or `/storage/usbstick-msdos`).
* "How much storage do you want to dedicate to your backup in megabytes ? Recommendation: 2-3 times the amount of data to be
backed up. Enter a number to consist of figures only."
Amanda will use at most this number of megabytes in total as its storage for backup.
If you choose to include the raw device in the backup cycle (next question), that means you should enter 3 times the size of
your SD disk NOW. If you choose not to include it (or selected the AWS S3 variant which omits raw SD backups per default), it's
a lot less data and you need to estimate it by adding up the size of the config directories that are listed in the `disklist` 
file. If you don't have any idea and chose to NOT backup your SD card, enter 1024 (= 1 GByte). If you chose to backup it, the number
should be larger than the SD capacity in megabytes plus 1024.
You can change it in the Amanda config file at any later time (the entry below the line reading `define tapetype DIRECTORY {`.
* "Backup raw SD card ?" (not asked if you selected AWS S3 storage)
Answer "yes" if you want to create raw disk backups of your SD card. This is only recommended if your SD card is 8GB or less in
size, otherwise the backup can take too long. You can always add/remove this by editing `${confdir}/disklist` at a later time.

All of your input will be used to create the initial Amanda config files, but you are free to change them later on.
HEADS UP: if you re-run the install routine, it will OVERWRITE the config files at any time so if you make changes there,
remember these changes and store them elsewhere, too.
Once you're done installing openHABian and Amanda, proceed to the usage guide chapter below.

Finally, another HEADS UP: The first thing you should do after your first backup run ended successfully is to create a clone of
your active server SD card by restoring the backup to a blank SD card as shown below as an `amfetchdump` example for recovery of a
raw device's contents. `/dev/mmcblk0` is the Pi's internal SD reader device, and from an Amanda perspective, this is a raw
device to be backed up to have that same name.
You will have two Amanda config directories (located in `/etc/amanda`) called `openhab-dir` and `openhab-AWS` if you choose to
setup both of them.
If any of your Amanda backup or recovery runs fails (which might well be the case particularly if you try to use the S3 backup),
you should try getting it to work following the guides and knowledge base available on the Web at http://www.amanda.org/.
There's online documentation including tutorials and FAQs at http://wiki.zmanda.com/index.php/User_documentation.
In case you come across inherent problems or improvements, please let us (openHABian authors) know through a GitHub issue, but
please don't expect us to guide you through Amanda, which is a rather complex system, and we're basically just users only, too.


# Operating Amanda - a (yes, very brief) usage guide

The overall config is to be found in `/etc/amanda/openhab-<config>/amanda.conf`.
You are free to change this file, but doing so is at your own risk.
You can specify files, directories and raw devices (such as HDD partitions or SD cards) that you want to be backed up in
`/etc/amanda/openhab-<config>/disklist`. You are free to add more lines here to have Amanda also take backup of other
directories of yours.

Note: the raw SD card backup was left out for the AWS S3 config, as that would require a lot of bandwidth and runtime.

openHABian setup routine will create cron entries in `/etc/cron.d/amanda` to start all backups you select every night at 01:00AM. 

## Backup

Find below a terminal session log of a manually started backup run.
It's showing the three most important commands to use. They all can be started as user _backup_ only, interactively or via cron, 
and you always need to specify the config to use. You can have multiple backup configs in parallel use.

The `amcheck` command is meant to remind you to put in the right removeable storage medium such as a tape or SD card,
but for the AWS and local/NAS-mounted directory based backup configs, we don't have removable media. So don't get confused,
`amcheck` is not a required step.

The `amdump` command will start the backup run itself. 
The result will be mailed to you (if your mail system was properly configured which is currently not the case with openHABian).

You can run `amreport <config>` at any time to see a report on the last backup run for that config.

**Reminder:** you have to be logged in as the `backup` user. To accomplish that, you can also login as your ordinary user and
use the `sudo` (execute commands with superuser privileges) and `su` (switch user) commands as shown below.

```
pi@pi:/etc/amanda/openhab-dir $ sudo su - backup
backup@pi:~$

## Restore

### Restoring a file

To restore a file, you need to use the `amrecover` command as the `root` user.
Note that since Amanda is designed to restore ANY file of the system, you are required to run `amrecover` as the root user to
have the appropriate file access rights.

`amrecover` sort of provides a shell-like interface to allow for navigating through the stored files.
Here's another terminal session log to show how a couple of files are restored into a target directory `/server/temp`.

```

### Restoring a partition

To restore a raw disk partition, you need to use `amfetchdump` command. Unlike `amdump`, you have to run amfetchdump as user backup, though.
Here’s another terminal session log to use `amfetchdump` to first retrieve the backup image from your backup storage to image called
`openhabianpi-image` on `/server/temp/`

**Reminder:** you have to be logged in as the `backup` user. 

```
backup@pi:/server/temp$ amfetchdump -p openhab-dir pi /dev/mmcblk0 > /server/temp/openhabianpi-image
 1 volume(s) needed for restoration
  The following volumes are needed: openhab-openhab-dir-001
  Press enter when ready
```

Before you actually press enter, you should get ready, by opening another terminal window and letting Amanda know in which slot the required
tape is (you can do this also before starting the `amfetchdump` command). You have to find the slot yourself by checking their content. Once
you find out the requested file (probably starting with `00000.`), you redirect amanda to use the slot which contains the file (e.g. slot 1)
using this:

```
backup@pi:/server/temp$ amtape openhab-dir slot 1
slot   1: time 20170322084708 label openhab-openhab-dir-001
changed to slot 1
```

Finally you can go back to the first terminal window and press Enter. Amanda will automatically pick up the other files if the backup
consists of more than one file.

```
amfetchdump: 4: restoring split dumpfile: date 20170322084708 host pi disk /dev/mmcblk0 part 1/UNKNOWN lev 0 comp N program APPLICATION
  927712 kb
```

You can also provide amfetchdump with the date of the backup that you want to restore by adding the date parameter (format e.g. 20180327)
like this:

```
backup@pi:/server/temp$ amfetchdump -p openhab-dir pi /dev/mmcblk0 > /server/temp/openhabianpi-image 20180327
```

This line also shows how to restore this image file to a SD card from Linux. In this example, we have an external SD card writer with a
(blank) SD card attached to /dev/sdd.

```
backup@pi:/server/temp$ dd bs=4M if=/server/temp/openhabianpi-image of=/dev/sdd
```

You could also move that temporary recovered image file to your Windows PC that has a card writer, rename the file to have a .raw extension,
and use Etcher or other tool in order to write the image to the card.


### A final word on when things have gone badly wrong...

and your SD card to contain the Amanda database is broken: don't give up!
Whenever you use a directory as the storage area, openHABian Amanda by default creates a copy of its config and index files (to know what's
stored where) in your storage directory once a day (see `/etc/cron.d/amanda`). So you can reinstall openHABian including Amanda from scratch
and copy back those files. Even if you fail to recover your index files, you can still access the files in your storage area. Backed-up
directories are stored as tar files with a header, here's an example how to decode them:

```
